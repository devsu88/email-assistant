Email Assistant Agents

This module defines three specialized agents and one handoff agent:
- EmailClassifierAgent: categorizes emails into business categories
- EmailSummarizerAgent: creates concise summaries of email content
- ReplyGeneratorAgent: generates professional reply suggestions
- EmailHandoffAgent: orchestrates the workflow between the three agents

        Follow these steps carefully:
        1. Classify Email: Use the email_classifier_agent tool to categorize the email (Inquiry, Complaint, Feedback, Other)
        2. Summarize Email: Use the email_summarizer_agent tool to create a two-sentence summary
        3. Generate Reply: Use the reply_generator_agent tool to create a professional reply suggestion
        4. Handoff for Processing: Pass the results to the 'Email Processor' agent for final formatting
        
        Crucial Rules:
        - You must use the agent tools to process the email â€” do not process them yourself
        - You must hand off the results to the Email Processor for final formatting
        - Ensure all three steps (classify, summarize, generate reply) are completed
