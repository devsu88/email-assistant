Subject: Issue with my account login

Hi Support Team,

I've been trying to log into my account for the past two days but keep getting an error message saying "Invalid credentials". I'm sure I'm using the correct password as I haven't changed it recently. This is very frustrating as I need to access my account urgently for an important project.

Could you please help me resolve this issue as soon as possible?

Best regards,
John Smith

Subject: Question about pricing plans

Hello,

I'm interested in your premium service but I have a few questions about the pricing structure. Could you please clarify:

1. What's included in the premium plan?
2. Is there a discount for annual subscriptions?
3. Can I upgrade from the basic plan mid-month?

I'm looking to make a decision by the end of this week.

Thanks,
Sarah Johnson

Subject: Feedback on your new feature

Hi Product Team,

I've been using your new dashboard feature for a few weeks now and I wanted to share some feedback. The interface is much cleaner and more intuitive than before. However, I think it would be even better if you could add a dark mode option and maybe some customization for the layout.

Overall, great work on the update!

Best,
Mike Chen

Subject: Terrible customer service experience

Dear Management,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received yesterday. The representative I spoke with was rude, unhelpful, and completely ignored my concerns. This is not the first time I've had issues with your customer service, and I'm seriously considering switching to a competitor.

This is unacceptable and I demand a full refund for my last three months of service.

Regards,
Lisa Thompson

Looking forward to hearing from you.
